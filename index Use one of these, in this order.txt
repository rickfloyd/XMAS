Use one of these, in this order:

server.ts (best / most common)

src/server.ts (if you have a src folder)

index.ts (if your project already uses index)

Where to put it

Put it in the folder where these relative imports will work:

import { db } from './database';
import { cacheService } from './services/cache';
import { chartController } from './controllers/charts';
import { WebSocketService } from './services/websocket';


That means the file must sit next to:

database.ts

the services/ folder

the controllers/ folder

So your folder should look like this:

src/
  server.ts    <-- this file
  database.ts
  controllers/
    charts.ts
  services/
    cache.ts
    websocket.ts
  types/
    ...

Notepad steps (fast)

Open Notepad

Paste the code

Save As

Save as type: All Files

File name: server.ts
