Data Coverage and Reliability 

The biggest lie in finance platforms is silent data failure. A platform can have 1,800 symbols, but if 10% are stale or mismapped, traders stop trusting everything. Your strategy is smarter: start with fewer markets, make them rock-solid, and expand only after stability. Reliability becomes your brand.

You already have multiple data providers. Your moat here is a redundancy layer + normalization. Redundancy means each market has a primary feed and an automatic fallback. Normalization means every asset has one internal symbol so users never see weird duplicates or missing charts. If a provider fails, Quantum doesn’t break; it switches or goes into “honest degraded mode.”

“Honest degraded mode” is how you beat TradingView emotionally. Instead of failing quietly or spinning forever, you show last good price + timestamp + source. Traders respect honesty. That respect becomes loyalty.

Steps

Choose Day-1 markets only (FX majors, top crypto, gold, DXY, S&P/Nasdaq).

Assign Primary + Backup provider per market.

Build one internal symbol list that maps all providers to the same names.

Set freshness targets per market (seconds for FX/crypto, minutes ok for indices).

Cache lists/scanners; keep only open charts fully real-time.

Create degraded mode UI: last price + timestamp + “data delayed” note.

Display source quietly near price.

Log every outage/lag automatically.

Run 3 stress tests (quota hit, outage, traffic spike).

Expand markets only after stability stays green for 30 days.
