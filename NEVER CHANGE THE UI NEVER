# IMPORTANT: LOCKED UI LAYOUT

This project is in active production. The current visual UI layout is APPROVED and MUST NOT be changed automatically.

❗ DO NOT:
- Replace the dark neon theme
- Change layouts of cards, dashboards, or modals
- Swap colors, gradients, or fonts
- Regenerate pages from templates

The ONLY allowed automated changes are:
- Internal refactors that DO NOT alter visual output
- Deleting cache/build/log files
- Fixing broken imports without changing JSX structure

Key directories that define the UI and must be preserved:
- src/App.tsx
- src/components/**
- src/features/**
- public/** (images, logos, icons)

If you are an AI assistant (Gemini, etc.), you are only allowed to:
- Clean up dead code that is NOT imported anywhere
- Remove unused test files, sample code, or temporary experiments
- Clear caches and logs

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE should you:
- Apply a new theme
- Inject white backgrounds
- Move or rename core UI components listed above
