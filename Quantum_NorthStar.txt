NORTHERN STAR  

LEVEL 1 — North Star, First Tribe, and the Real Enemy

Quantum Charts can beat TradingView only if it wins one tribe first, then expands. TradingView’s power is also its weakness: it tries to serve everyone at once, so the interface becomes a junkyard of features, opinions, and distractions. Your edge is clarity. The first tribe should be the group that feels this pain the most and spreads fast when helped—retail FX + crypto traders who want pro power without mental overload. When you lock this tribe, you create a beachhead that funds everything else.

The “North Star” is not a slogan. It’s a filter that decides what gets built and what gets killed. Every feature you add either makes the user’s daily loop easier or it doesn’t. Your loop is: scan → see clean setup → get evidence/risk plan → save/share/execute → review. If a feature doesn’t strengthen that loop for your first tribe, you don’t ship it yet. That’s how you avoid becoming the next clutter monster.

Your sacred values are the moat: clarity-first, anti-scam, neutral evidence, accessibility, and global friendliness. These are not marketing words; they become design requirements and policy hard-stops. That’s how you become “everything to every trader” without becoming a sellout—because the foundation is aligned before growth tempts you.

Write the daily loop in 5 verbs: Scan → Chart → Plan → Execute/Share → Review.

List 3 Year-1 measurable goals (users, retention, revenue).

List 5 sacred values.

List 3 “we do NOT do this” rules (e.g., pumps, pay-to-rank, chaos UI).

Print this page.

Tape it to your monitor.

Use it to approve/deny every future feature.
