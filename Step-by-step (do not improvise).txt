Step-by-step (do not improvise)

Right-click anywhere inside Firebase Studio

Click Inspect

Click the Console tab

Click View → Chat again

Watch the console

You will see one of these (or similar):

403 Forbidden

assistant disabled

feature unavailable

quota exceeded

permission denied

assistant capability not enabled

That is Google saying:

“This workspace is not allowed to use Gemini anymore.”
